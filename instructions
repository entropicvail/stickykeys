	Assumptions & Caveats:
-	Assuming physical access to the target machine
-	Assuming no BIOS power-on password or Full-Disk Encryption
-	Assuming Windows OS is installed on C:
- Assuming Sticky Keys is enabled (Windows default)
- Caveat: There is little difference between this method and side-loading a Lixux OS or using the Windows Recovery/Installation media to directly interact with the Windows OS files with SYSTEM level permissions
	- Advantages:
		- Windows Recovery/Installation boot media looks innocuous.
		- Provides SYSTEM level permissions in an interactive OS environment
			- Allows you to create/modify accounts
			- Allows you to execute code in OS
	
	Preparation:
1.	Download Microsoft Recovery/Installation media and flash to bootable USB drive.

	- Name the newly created value DisableAntiSpyware and press Enter
	- Double-click DisableAntiSpyware and set its value to 1
		- Click OK and restart the computer
		
8.	When Windows boots, press any key/s to invoke the log-in screen (you want to be looking at the Username/Password fields).
